=======
**CiMon (Chili Monitoring)** is a cloud-based application designed to detect diseases in chili plants by analyzing leaf images. Utilizing Machine Learning technology, this application delivers fast and accurate detection results, assisting farmers in identifying and addressing plant diseases early to enhance crop productivity.
## Cloud Computing Application API

This repository contains the backend implementation for a cloud computing application using **Node.js** and **Express**. The API is built with various dependencies to support robust functionality and is integrated with multiple Google Cloud services:

- **Cloud Build**: For automating the build process.  
- **Cloud Run**: For deploying containerized applications.  
- **Cloud SQL**: Used as the primary database.  
- **Firebase Authentication**: For secure user authentication.  
- **Cloud Storage**: For storing and managing application data.  
- **Artifacts Registry**: Utilized to store and manage Docker container images, built using a custom `Dockerfile`.  

This project is designed to demonstrate scalable and efficient backend development leveraging modern cloud infrastructure.
